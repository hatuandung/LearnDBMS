<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.</p>
<p>
<hr />
<h2>What is SQL?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>SQL stands for Structured Query Language
  <li>SQL lets you access and manipulate databases
  <li>SQL is an ANSI (American National Standards Institute) standard
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>What Can SQL do?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>SQL can execute queries against a database
  <li>SQL can retrieve data from a database
  <li>SQL can insert records in a database
  <li>SQL can update records in a database
  <li>SQL can delete records from a database
  <li>SQL can create new databases
  <li>SQL can create new tables in a database
  <li>SQL can create stored procedures in a database
  <li>SQL can create views in a database
  <li>SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>SQL is a Standard - BUT....</h2>
<p>Although SQL is an ANSI (American National Standards Institute) standard, there are many different versions of the SQL language.</p>
<p>However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE) in a similar manner.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Most of the SQL database programs also have their own proprietary extensions in addition to the SQL standard!</p>
<hr />
<h2>Using SQL in Your Web Site</h2>
<p>To build a web site that shows some data from a database, you will need the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An RDBMS database program (i.e. MS Access, SQL Server, MySQL)
  <li>A server-side scripting language, like PHP or ASP
  <li>SQL
  <li>HTML / CSS
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>RDBMS</h2>
<p>RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.</p>
<p>RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems like MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.</p>
<p>The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables.</p>
<p>A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows.</p>
<hr />
<p>We will list the SQL syntax for each of the SQL commands in this section of tutorial later, making this an easy reference for someone who wants to learn SQL.</p>
