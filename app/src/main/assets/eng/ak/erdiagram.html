<h3>E-R Diagram</h3>
<p>
ER-Diagram is a visual representation of data that describes how data is related to each other. 
</p>
<p class="center"><img src="./erdiagram_files/er-diagram.jpg" alt="example of er-diagram"></p>

<h4>Symbols and Notations</h4>

<h3>Components of E-R Diagram</h3>
<p>
The E-R diagram has three main components. 
</p>
<h4>1) Entity</h4>
<p>
An <b>Entity</b> can be any object, place, person or class. In E-R Diagram, an <b>entity</b> is represented using rectangles. Consider an example of an Organisation. Employee, Manager, Department, Product and many more can be taken as entities from an Organisation.  
</p>

<hr>
<h4>Weak Entity</h4>
<p>
Weak entity is an entity that depends on another entity. Weak entity doen't have key attribute of their own. Double rectangle represents weak entity. 
</p>

<hr>
<h4>2) Attribute</h4>
<p>An <b>Attribute</b> describes a property or characterstic of an entity. For example, Name, Age, Address etc can be attributes of a Student. An attribute is represented using eclipse.</p>
<p class="center"><img src="./erdiagram_files/attribute-example.jpg" alt="attribute example"></p>
<hr>
<h4>Key Attribute</h4>
<p>Key attribute represents the main characterstic of an Entity. It is used to represent Primary key. Ellipse with underlying lines represent Key Attribute.</p>
<p class="center"><img src="./erdiagram_files/key-attribute-example.jpg" alt="key attribute example"></p>
<hr>
<h4>Composite Attribute</h4>
<p>An attribute can also have their own attributes. These attributes are known as <b>Composite</b> attribute.</p>
<p class="center"><img src="./erdiagram_files/composite-attribute-example.jpg" alt="composite attribute example"></p>
<hr>
<h4>3) Relationship</h4>
<p>
A Relationship describes relations between <b>entities</b>. Relationship is represented using diamonds.  
</p>
<p class="center"><img src="./erdiagram_files/relationship-example.jpg" alt="relationship example"></p>

<p>There are three types of relationship that exist between Entities.</p>
<ul class="content">
<li>Binary Relationship</li>
<li>Recursive Relationship</li>
<li>Ternary Relationship</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4>Binary Relationship</h4>
<p>Binary Relationship means relation between two Entities. This is further divided into three types.</p>
<ol class="content">
<li><b>One to One :</b> This type of relationship is rarely seen in real world.</li>
<p class="center"><img src="./erdiagram_files/one-to-one-example.jpg" alt="one-to-one example"></p>
<p>The above example describes that one student can enroll only for one course and a course will also have only one Student. This is not what you will usually see in relationship.</p>
<li><b>One to Many :</b> It reflects business rule that one entity is associated with many number of same entity. The example for this relation might sound a little weird, but this menas that one student can enroll to many courses, but one course will have one Student.</li>
<p class="center"><img src="./erdiagram_files/one-to-many-example.jpg" alt="one-to-many example"></p>
<p>The arrows in the diagram describes that one student can enroll for only one course.</p>

<li><b>Many to One :</b> It reflects business rule that many entities can be associated with just one entity. For example, Student enrolls for only one Course but a Course can have many Students.</li>
<p class="center"><img src="./erdiagram_files/many-to-one.jpg" alt="one-to-many example"></p>

<li><b>Many to Many :</b></li>
<p class="center"><img src="./erdiagram_files/many-to-many-example.jpg" alt="many-to-many example"></p>
<p>The above diagram represents that many students can enroll for more than one courses.</p></ol>
<hr>
<h4>Recursive Relationship</h4>
<p>
When an Entity is related with itself it is known as <b>Recursive</b> Relationship.
</p>
<p class="center"><img src="./erdiagram_files/recursive-relationship.jpg" alt="recursive relationship example"></p>
<hr>
<h4>Ternary Relationship</h4>
<p>Relationship of degree three is called Ternary relationship.</p>
